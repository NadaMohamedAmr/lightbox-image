Dear All,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to submit the Responsive Image Gallery with Lightbox project as part of the [position/program/etc.] application process. The project demonstrates my skills in building responsive, user-friendly applications using React.js and modern front-end development techniques such asFlexbox, and lazy loading for performance optimization.

You can access the project on GitHub via the following link: [https://nadamohamedamr.github.io/lightbox-image/]

The repository includes a detailed README.md file with clear instructions for running the application locally, as well as an overview of the technologies used, the project's key features, and performance optimization techniques.
